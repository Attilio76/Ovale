Change OvaleScripts into a script manager.

	Store scripts in global SavedVariables databases.

	Layout with left pane as script names/descriptions and right pane as the selected script.
		Left pane:
			Show all scripts for that class, default scripts listed first (bolded), rest after.
			Allow creating a new, empty script with a default name.
			Allow deleting non-default scripts.
		Right pane:
			Allow viewing of default scripts -- "Accept" is a no-op.
			Allow editing of non-default scripts -- "Accept" to save script into database.
